# Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression and Random Forest

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline for the early detection of breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective is to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on features computed from digitized images of breast mass fine needle aspirates (FNAs).

Two classification models are developed and compared:

Logistic Regression – for its interpretability and baseline performance.

Random Forest Classifier – for its ensemble learning capability and improved accuracy.

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
